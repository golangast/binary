            <p class="par">
                I first started my interest in programming when I bought my first phone in around 2011 and wanted to try to change how
                it worked. I would download scripts or roms to try and change how it looked. I would visit
                https://www.xda-developers.com a lot and read about changes or hacks you can do to make the operating
                system work differently. This was around the time I was a drafter being subcontracted by BP.

            <p class="par">
                I had always wanted to learn how to change these but I did not have the time. Eventually, the Exemplar
                project at BP was completed and they had laid off the whole floor of staff. So I talked to a friend who was a programmer
                and I had taken a few classes in introduction of programming and databases in 2011. I eventually kept taking
                programming classes like C# Programming I, C# Programming II, VB.NET Programming I, C++
                Programming I, PHP Programming I, PHP Programming II, Advanced Web Page Authoring, Spec Topic:
                Obj.-Oriented CSS. I eventually got the C# Programmer Certificate, PHP Programmer Certificate, and
                Database Admin Certificate.

            <p class="par">
                On the side, during school, I picked up a lot about CSS and JQuery. I had started to pick up a lot of
                frameworks like angular, Vue, React, and nodejs. I had spent much of my time outside of school trying to
                build on the front end. I had wanted a way to learn restful so I spent a lot of time learning Python and
                using its frameworks like Django and Flask.

                I was the type of student that would come early and stay late bothering the teachers
                talking about programming. I had found an old email I had wrote to the head of Information
                Technology department.

                                Well, I started with Visual Studio with the small basics. I then took C++ and Visual
                                Basic during the summer in Visual Studio and C# with Dawn. This gave me a background in
                                OOP. With the start of web design, there were a lot of IDEs I had used. I think the web
                                design had gotten me started on a lot of different syntax and programming languages. I
                                had gotten into PHP/phpmyadmin/mysql during my PHP class.

                                I then took the jQuery class and began my learning of JavaScript. Which opened up a lot
                                of different javascript libraries (angular.js, greensock.js, impress.js, canvas.js,
                                grunt.js, bower.js, node.js) I then took Eric's class with the object-oriented CSS. He
                                introduced me to SASS, Compass, CodeKit, animate.css, font-awesome, and Modular CSS. I
                                tried to venture on my own with a little JSON and tried to use vanilla javascript. I had
                                taken a couple of database classes along the way. With using Access, Oracle Sql
                                Developer, Microsoft's Mysql and IIS.

                                I think using all these different languages helped me understand each other more and in
                                a new light. Right now the PHP2 is going over sorting multidimensional arrays. In C# we
                                just tried to use Lists because they were the fastest. In VB we used multiple forms to
                                create a program. In ASP.NET we are using a database to hold data that will be used in
                                forms. I enjoyed the JQuery class the most though. It seemed to have a basic but
                                free-form approach to technology. It is what got me into all the javascript libraries.

                                To be honest, I wish to learn more about JavaScript and try to build something of my
                                own. It seems like the javascript community is growing and is well documented and
                                changing. Especially with node.js, JSON, and directive creating coming onto the scene.
                                The only problem is to focus on one technology and try to find a job in it. I was
                                building my website with greensock.js and grunt.js but now I have to spend more time on
                                the backend to make the website dynamic.

                                There simply is not enough time in the day to learn it all. I have a programming friend
                                who is now learning Xamarin. This is because .net went cross-platform and open source.
                                So now the big thing is mobile C# designing for Android and IOS. Just today my
                                programming friend showed me Microsoftâ€™s HoloLens and is gonna start doing that. I
                                really would not have gotten into what I have without teachers like Dawn and Eric. I
                                also would not have known as much without my brother pushing me for the javascript and
                                my programming friend telling me about C# and all the professionals that post really
                                helpful blogs. I hope that is a good start.

                I eventually was employed at Dealereprocess where I support, launch, and then Support tier 2. I had just gotten employee of the month and really 
                enjoy working with the teams I am with. I had through outside of work switched between frontend to backend and between languages and frameworks. I
                eventually picked up Go and that has been my side language for a couple of years now.
